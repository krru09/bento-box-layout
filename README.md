## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I really disliked working with CSS prior to this project. Even while working on this project, I have never worked on a complex grid layout before. When I first started the project, I thought working with mobile-first approach might've been best. But since the desktop layout is more complex, I decided to recourse and do desktop first, and then adjust my styles for smaller screens.

While doing the project, I originally thought that we only needed to break up the sections in 2, not 3 -- the two elements on the left, and the rest of the elements to the right of it. But after watching some CSS grid videos online, I realized that I needed to break it up into multiple sections (total 4). I also forgot about the CSS grid-area and grid-template-areas properties.. that made this way easier!

### Continued development

The sizing for my desktop is way too large, I think some further work to make this project really complete is sizing the bento grid down so it's not so large and did not need to be scrolled.
